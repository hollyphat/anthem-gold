        <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#3"> I need an explanation on why not just buy into the ICO sale? Does the note give any chance of receiving profits if the company is successful?</a>

            The convertible note works like equity but with extra protections for the investor such as a discount rate of 20% upon conversion at a maximum valuation capped at $7.5 million and accruing interest at a rate of 7% per year before conversion into equity

            We foresee AnthemGold Inc. equity holders will benefit from our company's successes from eventual potential dividends issued as well as from a future liquidity event such as an acquisition.

            AnthemGold plans to launch an access/use token which verifies chain of custody and custodianship of gold kilogram bars backing ANTHEMS (AGLD) with a broader application of supply chain management of any interchangeable/fungible good. We plan to offer all individuals pre-ICO (‘Initial Coin/Token Offering’) access of our verification token. Investors who have pledged at least $50k, an equivalent of at least 10% of the stated maximum raise amount on BnkToTheFuture, will be able to sell their verification tokens immediately after the completion of the ICO at the time of their choosing and willalso have immediate access to me, and through me, access to team members as well. Investors who pledge $50k or more in this round will be part of our Founder’s Circle.

        <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#6">I don't fully understand your business model with the exchanges. Do you mean that you receive a % of the trading fees?</a>
        <div class="cd-faq-content">
          <p>
            Our business model is simple. Initially we make the majority of our profits from additional margin of issuing and selling 1,000 AGLD (each AGLD is backed by 1 gram of gold) and the cost of a 1 kilogram gold bar. Our estimated AGLD margins are included on our Business Model slide (Estimate of 15% Gross Margin in Year 1).
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time, we earn revenue from additional channels including issuing additional asset-backed and utility-based tokens, breakage revenue from storage fee margins after 36 months of included storage and wallet-related revenues such as from card swipe and loan origination fees. Additional information is available in our 5-year proforma financial projections.

            AGLD is a fully gold-backed Ethereum token built on the ERC20 Ethereum Token Standard. At the end of 30 months, a new AGLD token is to be issued on the most time-efficient, cost-efficient and relatively secure blockchain as exists at the time of issuance. For first six months after the new AGLD token launch, we will make all 1st edition AGLD redeemable 1-to-1 with the new 2nd edition token and no new 1st edition AGLD tokens will be issued. We will work with exchanges to enable clients to easily swap to the newest AGLD in their wallets who wish to do so. Starting after the end of the 39th month, .09% of the gold backing the token will be sold every 3 months to cover insured storage costs.

        <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#9">hat is your advantages against DigixDAO (digix.io), who did 5.5 mlnUSD ICO within 12hours only in March 2016?</a>
        <div class="cd-faq-content">
          <p>
            Digix made the announcement over 13 months ago about releasing a simple gold token DGX which has yet to be released. We do not know much about Digix except they appear to be in Singapore. AnthemGold, Inc. has a US-based executive and management team with known experience developing in the digital gold and cryptocurrency space. At AnthemGold, we seek like-minded individuals to create a community as our goal is to create a decentralized gold token. Ultimately it will come down to which team and which associated community can demonstrate the best proof of existence model.
